 Write a program that, after reading from keyboard the names of two checkpoints (entry and exit, respectively), verifies whether it is possible to reach the exit checkpoint directly (i.e., in one single motorway section), starting from the entry one. If so, it should display the corresponding fare with two decimal digits.

# If it is not possible to reach the exit checkpoint directly, the program should verify whether it is possible to reach it in a maximum of three consecutive motorway sections, and display:

# 1) the total number of motorway sections of the journey
# 2) the total fare of the journey, with two decimal digits.

# In case it is not possible to reach the exit checkpoint in a maximum of three consecutive sections, the program should display a suitable message on the screen and terminate.
