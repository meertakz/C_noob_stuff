Implement a function void printDate(char *date) that receives a date in the format “dd-mm-aaaa” and prints it in a verbose form in the screen.



For example, “10-05-2002” should be printed as 10 May 2002.



If the input date is not correctly formatted (for example: 09/12-1998 ) or it is not a correct date (for example: 45-01-2001, 10-13-2003), the function should print an error message. 



For simplicity, assume that all the months contain 30 days.
