Implement a function that, similar to the strstr() function of <string.h> searches a substring s2 in the string s1.
____________________________________
`
char* findSubstring(char s1[], char s2[])
`
____________________________________
The function should return a pointer to the first occurrence of the whole sequence of characters of s2 in s1

(‘\0’ excluded), or a NULL pointer if the sequence is not present.

NB. You can use the functions of <string.h> in your implementation, but NOT strstr()!
